## ⚙️ Workflow & Integration

### Project Management
We utilize **Jira** for agile project management. Our Scrum board follows a strict pipeline to ensure delivery quality:
`Backlog` ➡️ `To Do` ➡️ `In Progress` ➡️ `Review` ➡️ `Testing` ➡️ `Done`

### Development Workflow
We use **GitHub** for version control with a Jira integration:
1. **Branching:** `feature/MM-101-description`
2. **Commits:** Every commit includes the Jira Issue Key (e.g., `[MM-101]`).
3. **CI/CD:** Automated deployments to Vercel via GitHub Actions/Hooks for staging and production.
